‘Code Blue, Room\
452.”\
Is that us? Unsure, it’s the weekend.\
We go anyway.

Up the elevator\
Is it wrong to feel\
Excited?\
Will they know it’s\
My first one?

“I have a learner, he’ll be doing\
Compressions.”\
Oh good, I’ve been\
Announced.\
Handoff time, I start to get a bit\
Nervous.

Leg half on the bed, man this is\
Exhausting.\
Keep counting, keep pressing\
Is it time to switch? No?\
Keep going.

Who is this man?\
What is his name?\
Why is he here?\
Wait. If I don’t know him then\
Why am I he-\
Stop. It’s not\
The time for that.\
“Good compressions, go a bit\
Deeper.”

The quality wanes, so it’s\
Transition time, be smooth, then\
Wipe off sweat, shuffle away\
Catch your breath.\
Check? Oh that’s\
ROSC.

Time to go, we walk out\
No debrief. No time.\
Other still remain, now\
Back to the ER\
Down the elevator and\
Out of room 

452.\
Is that even the number?\
Months later I reflect\
Now it’s time but\
Honestly, I forget.

How to honor someone you\
Don’t know?

How can I celebrate?\
I’m not sure he’s still here. 

How can I grieve?\
I’m not sure he’s really gone.

What can I cling on to?\
When it’s tough, just remember\
ROSC achieved in room

452.
