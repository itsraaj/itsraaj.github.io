Code Blue in Room\
452.\
Is that us? Unsure, it’s the weekend.\
We go anyway.

Up the elevator\
Is it wrong to feel\
Excited?\
Will they know it’s\
My first one?

“I have a learner, he’ll be doing compressions.”\
Oh good, I’ve been\
Announced.\
Handoff time, I start to get a bit\
Nervous.

Leg half on the bed, man this is\
Exhausting.\
Keep counting, keep pressing\
Is it time to switch? No?\
Keep going.

Who’s this guy? What’s his name? Why’s he here?\
Why am I here?\
Stop. It’s not\
The time for that.\
Good compressions, go a bit\
Deeper.\
The quality wanes, so it’s

Transition time, be smooth, then\
Wipe off sweat, shuffle away and\
Catch your breath.\
Check? Oh that’s\
ROSC.

Time to go, we walk out\
No debrief. No time.\
Back to the ER\
Down the elevator\
Out of room

452.\
Is that even the number?\
Months later I reflect\
The details are vague\
Honestly, I forget.

How to honor someone you\
Don’t know?\
How can I grieve?\
I’m not sure he’s gone.\
How can I celebrate?\
I’m not sure he’s here.\
What can I cling on to?\
Just remember\
452.
