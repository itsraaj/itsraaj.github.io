### Hey, I'm Raaj. Not sure how you found this place but welcome.
### I use this place to [yap](/musings) into the ether and share my attempts to [write](/writing) more substantial things.
### Sometimes I post [other stuff](/stuff).
### This site is a personal project. It's powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and delivered via a [public repository](https://github.com/itsraaj/itsraaj.github.io) by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
